# Loan Prediction System Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview

This project is a Loan Prediction System developed as part of Artificial Intelligence course. 
It uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan should be approved based on applicant information.

The goal is to assist financial institutions in making more accurate and data-driven
 decisions when evaluating loan applications.

##  Problem Statement

Loan approval processes often involve manual judgment and are time-consuming. 
Automating this using machine learning helps in reducing delays and improving 
consistency in decision-making.

##  Dataset

The dataset was provided by the course lecturer and contains applicant features
 such as:

- Gender, Marital Status, Education
- Applicant Income, Loan Amount
- Credit History, Property Area
- Loan Status (target)

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

These models were trained and evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices.

##  Features of the System

- Predicts loan approval (Yes/No)
- Compares performance of three ML models
- Visualizes feature importance and confusion matrix
- Streamlit dashboard for user interaction

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- GitHub (for version control)
